def compute_reward(self, q, u):
    """
    Calculates the reward for given states and control inputs.

    Parameters:
    - q (np.ndarray): The observation is a `ndarray` with shape `(4,)` with the values corresponding to the following positions and velocities:
    
    | Num | Observation           | Min                 | Max               |
    |-----|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
    | 0   | Cart Position         | -4.8                | 4.8               |
    | 1   | Cart Velocity         | -Inf                | Inf               |
    | 2   | Pole Angle            | ~ -0.418 rad (-24°) | ~ 0.418 rad (24°) |
    | 3   | Pole Angular Velocity | -Inf                | Inf               |

    **Note:** While the ranges above denote the possible values for observation space of each element,
        it is not reflective of the allowed values of the state space in an unterminated episode. Particularly:
    -  The cart x-position (index 0) can be take values between `(-4.8, 4.8)`, but the episode terminates
       if the cart leaves the `(-2.4, 2.4)` range.
    -  The pole angle can be observed between  `(-.418, .418)` radians (or **±24°**), but the episode terminates
       if the pole angle is not in the range `(-.2095, .2095)` (or **±12°**)

    - u (np.ndarray):  The action is a `ndarray` with shape `(1,)` which can take values `{0, 1}` indicating the direction
     of the fixed force the cart is pushed with.

    | Num | Action                 |
    |-----|------------------------|
    | 0   | Push cart to the left  |
    | 1   | Push cart to the right |

    **Note**: The velocity that is reduced or increased by the applied force is not fixed and it depends on the angle
     the pole is pointing. The center of gravity of the pole varies the amount of energy needed to move the cart underneath it

    Returns:
    - float: The calculated rewards for the states and inputs. Since the goal is to keep the pole upright for as long as possible, a reward of `+1` for every step taken,
    including the termination step, is allotted. The threshold for rewards is 475 for v1.
